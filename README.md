# searchGPT - An Open-Source LLM-based Grounded Search Engine

**searchGPT** is an open-source project to build a search engine based on Large Language Model (LLM) technology to give natural language answers.

You may consider that this is a **minimal implementation of new Bing mainly for search engine and question answering**.

It supports using sources like the Internet and supports file content search.

Please give me a star if you like it! ðŸŒŸ

-   Please remain only UI search and don't call it with a program.
-   Please be patient for the search loading time, which usually need ~10 seconds

## Architecture and roadmap

## Why Grounded?

Because it is impossible for the LLM to learn everything during the training, thus real-time factual information is needed for reference.

Example of ungrounded false answers (both using `text-curie-001` model):

| The Ghost Kitchen is a place where the departed spirits of cooks and dishwashers can cook and wash dishes with ease. The kitchen is said to be especially busy on Full Moon nights                                        | A ghost kitchen is a physical space for operators to create food for off-premises consumption. [1] This type of kitchen doesn't have waiters, no dining room, and no parking lot â€“ really, no public presence whatsoever. [1] This kitchen is designed to cut unnecessary costs, allowing a restaurant to expand easily with low capital. [2] With apps like GrubHub and DoorDash, restaurant owners can easily find orders and exceed their expected revenue. [3]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Ghost Kitchen is a pop-up restaurant in London that is completely without food. Instead, the restaurant is filled with spirits, who banish negative energy and help to make the guests' dining experience more enjoyable. | A ghost kitchen is a professional kitchen that is set up to cook food for delivery or take-out but does not have a dine-in option. [1] Ghost kitchens are often located in areas with high foot traffic and are used by multiple restaurants. [1] This allows restaurant chains to test new menu items without the investment of a brick-and-mortar location. [2] By having all of your orders in one place, a ghost kitchen can minimize the chances of errors and increase efficiency. [3] Additionally, by being located close to customers, a ghost kitchen can increase revenue. [4] While ghost kitchens are here to stay, they will likely face competition from other restaurants in the near future. [1] |

| Japanese "www" is typically used as a placeholder for "www." For example, "This is www." is typically translated to "Kore wa www.". Japanese "www" is also used to indicate that a webpage is not currently being viewed. | The meaning of "www" in Japanese is typically used to show amusement or to convey sarcasm. [1] It can also be used as a casual way to say "yes" or "okay." Additionally, speakers of Japanese may use "w" to represent the kana "ç¬‘" in online chat because it looks similar to the character for "laugh." [2] |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run `searchGPT`, you'll need:

-   [Python 3.10.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
-   [OpenAI API Key](https://beta.openai.com/signup) or [GooseAI API Key](https://goose.ai/)
    -   OpenAI: First $18 is free (enough for you to have 3000+ searchs)
    -   GooseAI: First $10 is free
-   [Azure Bing Search Subscription Key](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/apis/bing-web-search-api/)
    -   Free version is available (3 searchs per second, 1000 searchs per month

### Installation

1. Create your python or anaconda env and install python packages

Native

```
# using python=3.10.8
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Anaconda

```
conda create --name searchgpt python=3.10.8
conda activate searchgpt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Input API keys (OpenAI/Azure Bing Search) in `backend/src/config/config.yaml` (or using UI)
3. Run `app.py`, (or `flask_app.py`) for frontend web app launching. `main.py` for stdout output only.

## Localization

searchGPT supports localized results from Bing and responses in multiple languages

Supported languages are located in `locales/[ISO-639]`. Every folder represents a language currently supported

To change the language edit `src/config/config.yaml` and put the `ISO-639` language code in:

```
system:
    locale : ISO-639 (es. en-US)
```

### Translate SearchGPT in your language

1. Create a folder in `locales` with the ISO-639 code of your language
2. Put `locales/base.pot` language template in your language folder and rename it `base.po`
3. Translate every string contained in `msgid` putting translated text inside `msgstr`
4. Locate `msgfmt.py` file. (Es. "C:/Users/{user}/anaconda3/envs/{env-name}/Tools/i18n/msgfmt.py")
5. Compile base.po in base.mo with `python "C:/Users/{user}/anaconda3/envs/{env-name}/Tools/i18n/msgfmt.py" ./locales/{your-lang}/LC_MESSAGES/base.po`
