Lean forward when you run and push off firmly with each foot. Pump your arms actively and keep your elbows bent at a 90-degree angle. Try to run every day, and gradually increase the distance you run for long-distance runs. Make sure you rest at least one day per week to allow your body to recover. Avoid running with excess gear that could slow you down."
